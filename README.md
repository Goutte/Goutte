### Hello World

As a kid I learned how to read in a BASIC manual because I wanted to code my own video game.
That pretty much says it all about me.

I'm making a game of Go that is played on a planet.  _(my arl√©sienne)_

Meanwhile, you can play [Cyx](https://antoine.goutenoir.com/games/cyx), it's easy and fun.
